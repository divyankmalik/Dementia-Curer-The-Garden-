# Dementia-Curer-The-Garden-
During my first semester of university, I collaborated with peers Nyang Lynn Kyaw, Huie Than, and Datth Eragam to develop a project called "The Garden." This project aimed to create a user-friendly website designed to support people with dementia by helping them manage daily tasks more easily, ultimately improving their quality of life.

**HOW THIS PROJECT WORKS?**
**Technical Side**
 For the technical part the languages used are:- HTML, CSS and Javascript. HTML to get a structure for each webpage, CSS to style them andd JavaScript to implement the actual functioning of the page.

 **User Experience Part**

Pixel Pair Panorama:- This Game shows the user a picture of a person close to them and asks the user to identify them and select an option from the options provided.

**WHAT NEEDS WORK?**
The Pixel Panorama Game needs to include a page where the user can input pictures of their close ones in order to customize the experience according to their personal prefrence.

**TEST CASES**
Each of our teammate asked elders in our family to play this game and find out if its helpful for them. In total we had 12 people who used the app out of which 9 people found it useful, which is about a **75% success rate**.
