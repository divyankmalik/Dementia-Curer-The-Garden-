# Dementia-Curer-The-Garden-
During my first semester of university, I collaborated with peers Nyang Lynn Kyaw, Huie Than, and Datth Eragam to develop a project called "The Garden." This project aimed to create a user-friendly website designed to support people with dementia by helping them manage daily tasks more easily, ultimately improving their quality of life.
